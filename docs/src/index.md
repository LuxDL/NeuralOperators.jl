# NeuralOperators

`NeuralOperators.jl` is a package written in Julia to provide the architectures for learning
mapping between function spaces, and learning grid invariant solution of PDEs.

## Installation

On Julia 1.10+, you can install `NeuralOperators.jl` by running

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("NeuralOperators")
```

Currently provided operator architectures are :

  - [Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)](models/fno.md)
  - [DeepONets](models/deeponet.md)
  - [Nonlinear Manifold Decoders for Operator Learning (NOMADs)](models/nomad.md)
